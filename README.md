# Wine-Quality

Notes from the task: 
- how to further increase the quality of the red wine assortment
- what leads to a good red wine rating
- input data - chemical properties
- output data - wine rating

# Aim:
- find out the drivers of the ratings
- make a recommendation of the selection?
  (here I need to think how to do it)

# Game Plan
1. read in the data from csv
2. split test and train (stratified sample)
3. feature selection techniques
4. create a pipeline to take a model and test it 
5. suggested models - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Network, samething else? 
6. align on the evaluation metrics - precision? 
7. what if we use clustering? 
8. create an automated package ?
9. it should be easy to understand from the model which are the drivers 
10. I can automate the data download from the web https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality 
11. note that this is an ordered output
12. k-fold cross validation? 
13. check for feature correlation
14. for the regression, we can play around with the L1 and L2 regularizations https://medium.com/@chandradip93/all-about-feature-selec-e6e88e8ccd46
